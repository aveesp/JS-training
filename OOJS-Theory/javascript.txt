Callback Functions (Higher Order Functions):
	-	function are actually first class object.
	-	just like you can pass function object as an arguments you can pass other function in to function as arguments. execute at some point.

Currying: 
	-	This is devloped by Hascal curry, Hansen curry.
	-	Closures to build currying.
	-	it is used to give color element do somoe manupulation.
	
innerfunction:
	-	innerfunction is a function defined within another function.
	function outerFunc(outerPara){
		function innerFunc(innerPara){
			return innerPara * 10;
		}
	}
	
Function Chaining:
